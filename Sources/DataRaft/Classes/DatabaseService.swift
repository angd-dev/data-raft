/// A base class for services that operate on a database connection.
///
/// `DatabaseService` provides a shared interface for executing operations on a `Connection`,
/// with support for transaction handling and optional request serialization.
///
/// Subclasses can use this base to coordinate safe, synchronous access to the database
/// without duplicating concurrency or transaction logic.
///
/// For example, you can define a custom service for managing notes:
///
/// ```swift
/// final class NoteService: DatabaseService {
///     func insertNote(_ text: String) throws {
///         try perform { connection in
///             let stmt = try connection.prepare(
///                 sql: "INSERT INTO notes (text) VALUES (?)"
///             )
///             try stmt.bind(text, at: 0)
///             try stmt.step()
///         }
///     }
///
///     func fetchNotes() throws -> [String] {
///         try perform { connection in
///             let stmt = try connection.prepare(sql: "SELECT text FROM notes")
///             var result: [String] = []
///             while try stmt.step() {
///                 if let text: String = stmt.columnValue(at: 0) {
///                     result.append(text)
///                 }
///             }
///             return result
///         }
///     }
/// }
///
/// let connection = try Connection(location: .inMemory, options: .readwrite)
/// let service = NoteService(connection: connection)
///
/// try service.insertNote("Hello, world!")
/// let notes = try service.fetchNotes()
/// print(notes) // ["Hello, world!"]
/// ```
///
/// This approach allows you to build reusable service layers on top of a safe, transactional,
/// and serialized foundation.
